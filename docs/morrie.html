<ul>
<li>“Life is a series of pulls back and forth… A tension of opposites,
like a pull on a rubber band. Most of us live somewhere in the middle. A
wrestling match… Which side win? Love wins. Love always wins”</li>
<li>“You see, you closed your eyes. That was the difference. Sometimes
you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And
if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that
you can trust them, too – even when you’re in the dark. Even when you’re
falling.”</li>
<li>“Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community
around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you
purpose and meaning.”</li>
