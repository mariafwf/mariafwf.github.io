                <span>“Life is a series of pulls back and forth... A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band.
                    Most of us live somewhere in the middle. A wrestling match...Which side win? Love wins. Love always
                    wins”</span>

                <span>“You see, you closed your eyes. That was the difference. Sometimes you cannot believe what you
                    see, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other people trust you,
                    you must feel that you can trust them, too -- even when you’re in the dark. Even when you’re
                    falling.”</span>
