<p>“Life is a series of pulls back and forth… A tension of opposites,
like a pull on a rubber band. Most of us live somewhere in the middle. A
wrestling match…Which side win? Love wins. Love always wins”

<p>“You see, you closed your eyes. That was the difference. Sometimes
you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And

falling.” {.entry}</p>
<p>“Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community
around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you
purpose and meaning.” {.entry}</p>
