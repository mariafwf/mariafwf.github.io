# If We Were Villains by M. L. Rio ![](./img/villains.jpeg)

* “For someone who loved words as much as I did, it was amazing how often they failed me.”
* “One thing I'm sure Colborne will never understand is that I need language to live, like food—lexemes and morphemes and morsels of meaning nourish me with the knowledge that, yes, there is a word for this. Someone else has felt it before.”
* “Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy. Heat them up, stir them together, and sometimes you get gold. Sometimes disaster.”
