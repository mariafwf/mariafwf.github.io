<li>“And so I try to be kind to everything I see, and in everything I
see, I see him.”</li>
<li>“You won’t understand what I mean now, but someday you will: the
only trick of friendship, I think, is to find people who are better than
you are—not smarter, not cooler, but kinder, and more generous, and more
forgiving—and then to appreciate them for what they can teach you, and
to try to listen to them when they tell you something about yourself, no
matter how bad—or good—it might be, and to trust them, which is the
hardest thing of all. But the best, as well.”</li>
<li>“But what was happiness but an extravagance, an impossible state to
maintain, partly because it was so difficult to articulate?”</li>
