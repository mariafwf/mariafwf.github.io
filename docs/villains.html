<ul>
<li>“For someone who loved words as much as I did, it was amazing how
often they failed me.”</li>
<li>“One thing I’m sure Colborne will never understand is that I need
language to live, like food—lexemes and morphemes and morsels of meaning
nourish me with the knowledge that, yes, there is a word for this.
Someone else has felt it before.”</li>
<li>“Actors are by nature volatile—alchemic creatures composed of
incendiary elements, emotion and ego and envy. Heat them up, stir them
together, and sometimes you get gold. Sometimes disaster.”</li>
